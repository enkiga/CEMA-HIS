# Health Information System

This project is a basic health information system developed as part of a Software Engineering Intern Task. It allows a doctor (system user) to manage clients and enroll them in various health programs. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application provides a user-friendly interface and a RESTful API for accessing client data.

## Features

* **Create Health Programs:** Easily add new health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV) to the system.
* **Register New Clients:** Securely register new clients with their relevant information.
* **Enroll Clients in Programs:** Enroll existing clients in one or more available health programs.
* **Search for Clients:** Quickly find clients from the registered list using various search criteria.
* **View Client Profile:** Access a detailed profile for each client, including their enrolled programs.
* **Client Profile API:** Exposes client profile data through a RESTful API endpoint for integration with other systems.
